# Database Scalability
# All you need to know

Exploring the Cornerstone of Successful SaaS Platforms  
  

**Ed Huang, Cofounder & CTO, PingCAP**

# Is your system really scalable?

What do we mean when we talk about database scalability?

- A few TBs?

**Scalability != Amount of Data. It's a multi-dimensional-problem**

# The First Principle of Scalability

- Fundamental principle:  **Expand from zero to many without design changes**
  - Little to no changes in code
  - No need to re-architect the system
  - No downtime

# Scalability Categories

- **Data and Throughput**
- **Metadata**
- **Connection and Resource Control**
- **Operate at scale, ease of use**
- **Self healing**
- **Debugging and reasoning about correctness at scale**
- **Advanced Features at scale**

---

# Scalability: Data and Throughput

- **Data Scalability:** 
  - Adding more nodes to handle increasing data volumes (e.g., TiDB can handle up to 1 PB)
- **Throughput Scalability:**
  - Increasing QPS and TPS to handle more queries and transactions (e.g., e-commerce platform during sales events)
  - Maintain SLAs as you scale your system

---

# When you gonna need it?

## *"I got both big tenants and small tenants"*
<br>

- For big tenants
  - Scale-out without pain
  - High isolation requirement
- For small tenants
  - Consolidate for saving cost
  - Rapid Growth

---

# How does TiDB tackles this?

- Horizontal scale-out
- Tenant isolation
- Cluster consolidation

---

# Metadata Scalability

- **Schema and Table Count Scalability:**
  - Supporting up to 1 million schemas/tables without performance loss
- **DDL Operations on massive database objects:**
  - Handling multiple concurrent DDL operations for evolving database structures

## Why? That's the most intutive way to build a multi-tenant system

---

# When are you gonna need it?

## *"Every tenant should have their own tables!"*

<br>
Let's do some simple math: A SaaS company has 10000 users(tenants), for each user, system will create 100 tables for them, the total numbner of tables will be:

10000 * 100 = 1 Million Tables!

If the metadata for each table in the database system is 10KB:

10 KB per table * 1M Tables = 10G

**Note that this is only the metadata**

Imagine if there's 10Mb in each table, that would be huge.

10Mb * 1M tables = 10 TB

# Connection and Resource Scalability

- **Connection Count Scalability:**
  - Managing millions of concurrent user connections
  - **Technical Implementation:** Connection Pooling, Asynchronous IO
- **Resource Utilization Scalability:**
  - Dynamic allocation and prioritization of resources (e.g., resource control for multi-tenant platforms)
  - **Technical Implementation:** Resource Groups, Quotas and Priorities, Dynamic Resource Allocation

::right::

* Big tenants
  - High isolation requirement
  - High resource consumption

* Small tenants
  - Low isolation requirement
  - Low resource consumption

* Fixed-size DB nodes are not flexible enough
